We have to show that for every $x_{n}, y_{n}, z_{n}$,

$$
\forall l \in \mathbb{R}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad x_{n} \leq y_{n} \leq z_{n} \wedge \lim x_{n} = \lim
z_{n} = l \implies \lim y_{n} = l.
$$


Suppose, then, that we have a three sequences $x_{n}, y_{n}, z_{n}$
satisfying the condition

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad x_{n} \leq y_{n} \leq z_{n}
$$
and for
which 
$$
\lim x_{n} = \lim z_{n} = l.
$$


By definition, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N_1$ for which

$$
x_{n} \in V_{\epsilon }(l)
$$
when $n \geq N_1$. Furthermore, there
also exists $N_2$ for which the inequality holds for the sequence
$z_{n}$. That is,

$$
\exists N_2 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N_2 \implies
z_{n} \in V_{\epsilon }(l)
$$


When $N = \max \{N_1, N_2\}$, for every $n \geq N$, all terms in $x_{n}$
and $z_{n}$ are in the $\epsilon$ neighborhood centered at $l$. However,
we ought to remind ourselves that the inequality also holds for this
neighborhood. That is,

$$
\forall n \geq N, \quad x_{n} \leq y_{n} \leq z_{n}.
$$


Therefore, $y_{n}$ also belongs to this neighborhood $\forall n \geq N$.
Thus, $y_{n}$ also converges to $l$.
