(a) **True.** By the order limit theorem, for any sequence $a_{n}$ that
converges to $a$,

$$
\forall c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad a_{n} \geq c
\implies a \geq c.
$$


By applying this theorem on the set $B$, we have

$$
\forall b \in B, \forall n \in \mathbb{R}, \quad a_{n} \geq b
\implies a \geq b
$$
and we can conclude that the
limit of $a_{n}$ also is an upper bound for all terms belonging to
$B$.

(b) **False.** We do a simple proof by contradiction. Suppose that the
sequence $a_{n}$ has all of its terms in

$$
(0, 1)^{c} = (-\infty, 0] \cup [1, \infty)
$$
but that its limit
$a$ is in $(0, 1)$. By definition, we can then choose $\epsilon = a$
for which

$$
\exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N
\implies \abs{a_{n} - a} < a.
$$


However, this implies that $a_{n}$ is in $(0, 1)$ for every $n
\geq N$ when we assumed that no $a_{n}$ is in
$(0, 1)$.

(c) **False.** We can create sequences that approach an irrational
number via only rational ones. The question is: do we have an
infinite number of irrational numbers ever closer to it? The answer
to that is \"yes\" since the rational numbers are dense in
$\mathbb{R}$.
