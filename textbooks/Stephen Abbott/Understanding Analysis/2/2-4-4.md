(a) Assume, for contradiction, that the natural numbers are bounded
above. Let's also assume that this upper bound is $u$. Since the
natural numbers are also increasing, we then know by MCT that the
sequence of natural numbers converges.

Assume that this limit is $L$. By our definition of convergence, we
have that for any $\epsilon > 0$,

$$
\exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N
\implies \abs{n - L} < \epsilon.
$$


However, if we choose $\epsilon = 1$, the application of the
definition implies that

$$
\exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N
\implies \abs{n - L} < 1.
$$
which is impossible
since $( n + 1 ) \not\in V_{1}(L)$. Therefore, the natural numbers
are unbounded and

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \; \exists n \in \mathbb{N}: \quad x < n.
$$


(b) Consider the intervals given by $I_{n} = [a_{n}, b_{n}]$, for all
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that

$$
I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \dots.
$$


Notice that the sequence $a_{n}$ is increasing (a contradiction
would arise if it were decreasing) and, likewise, the sequence
$b_{n}$ is decreasing. Since $a_{n}$ is bounded above by $b_1$ and
$b_{n}$ is bounded below by $a_1$, then both sequences converge.

Now, assuming that $a_{n}$ converges to $a$ and that $b_{n}$
converges to $b$, we can apply the Order Limit Theorem. Thus,

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad a_{n} \leq b_{n}
\implies a \leq b.
$$


Therefore,

$$
\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_{n} = [a, b] \neq \emptyset.
$$
