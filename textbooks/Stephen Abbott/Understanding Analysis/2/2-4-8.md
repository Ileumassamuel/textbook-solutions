(a) We define the partial sum $S_{n}$ as

$$
S_{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^{k}}.
$$


Notice that the sequence is increasing since it's a sum of positive
terms. Now, to prove that it's bounded above, let's use induction.
Consider the upper bound 2. The base case obviously holds since

$$
S_{1} = \frac{1}{2} \leq 2.
$$


For the induction step, suppose that $S_{n}$ is bounded above by 2.
Then, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n + 1} 
&= \sum_{k = 1}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{2^{k}} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{k = 2}^{n + 1} \frac{1}{2^{k}} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k = 1}^{n}
\frac{1}{2^k} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} S_{n} 
\leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} (2) = \frac{3}{2} \leq 2.
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, the partial sum indeed converges. By taking the limit of both
sides of the equation, and denoting $\lim S_{n}$ as $L$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim S_{n} = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}
\frac{1}{2^{k}}
&\implies L = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} (\sum_{k =
1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}) \\
&\implies L = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} L \\
&\implies \frac{L}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \\
&\implies L = 1.
\end{aligned}
$$


(b) We define the partial sum $S_{n}$ as

$$
S_{n} = \sum^{n}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k (k + 1)}.
$$
