(a) This is possible. Consider the sequences

$$
x_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, \dots)
$$
and 
$$
y_{n} = (1, 0, 1, 0, \dots).
$$

The sum of these two sequences gives us the constant sequence

$$
x_{n} + y_{n} = (1, 1, 1, 1, \dots)
$$
that clearly converges to 1,
although both $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ diverge.

(b) Intuitively, this claim is false. Suppose it were true, to attempt
to encounter a contradiction. That is, for any convergent sequence
$x_{n}$ and divergent sequence $y_{n}$, their sum
$c_{n} = x_{n} + y_{n}$ is a convergent sequence. Suppose further
that $x_{n}$ converges to $l$ and that $c_{n}$ converges to $r$.
Therefore, by the algebraic limit theorem, 
$$
\lim (c_{n} - x_{n}) 
= \lim c_{n} + \lim -x_{n}
= r - l.
$$
However, 
$$
\lim (c_{n} - x_{n})
= \lim(y_{n})
$$
and we therefore have a
contradiction since $y_{n}$ was not supposed to converge.

(c) Consider the convergent sequence

$$
b_{n} = (1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots)
$$

respecting the condition that

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad b_{n} \neq 0.
$$
Clearly, the
sequence 
$$
\frac{1}{b_{n}} = (1, 2, 4, 8, \dots)
$$
diverges.

(d) Difficult :(

(e) Take any possible divergent sequence $b_{n}$ imaginable. Now
consider the sequence 
$$
a_{n} = (0, 0, 0, 0, \dots)
$$
which clearly
converges to 0. If we multiply both sequences together, we end up
with the sequence 
$$
a_{n}b_{n} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \dots)
$$
which also
converges.
