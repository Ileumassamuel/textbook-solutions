(a) Notice that the sequence $y_{n}$ is decreasing since supposing the
opposite would lead to a contradiction. For contradiction, suppose
that $y_{n + 1} > y_{n}$. Then, 
$$
y_{n + 1} > y_{n}
\implies \sup \{ a_{k} : k \geq n + 1 \}  > \sup \{
a_{k} : k \geq n \}
$$


and this would then imply that $y_{n}$ is a smaller upper bound for
$\{ a_{k}: k \geq n + 1\}$, directly contradicting the definition of
a supremum.

Furthermore, since the sequence $a_{n}$ is bounded below (from
simply being bounded), then $y_{n}$ also is. Using $l$ to denote the
lower bound of $a_{n}$, that is because

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad l \leq \min_{k \geq n} a_{k}
\leq \sup_{k \geq n} a_{n} = y_{n}.
$$


Therefore, by applying MCT, we know that $y_{n}$ converges.

(b) We define $\lim \inf y_{n}$ as

$$
\lim \inf y_{n} = \inf \{ a_{k} : k \geq n \}.
$$


The reason why it always exists for bounded sequences is analog to
the reason given in (a). That is, $y_{n}$ is increasing and is
bounded above, thereby allowing us to apply MCT.

(c) Consider any bounded sequence $a_{n}$. Then, notice that

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \inf \{ a_{k} : k \geq n \} \leq \sup \{
a_{k} : k \geq n \} .
$$


Additionally, knowing from (a) and (b) that both sequences formed
converge (with the inf and sup functions\*), we can apply the Order
Limit Theorem to obtain

$$
\lim \inf \{ a_{k} : k \geq n \} \leq \lim \sup \{
a_{k} : k \geq n \}.
$$


A sequence for which is inequality is strict is the alternating
sequence 
$$
a_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \dots).
$$


Clearly, $\lim \inf a_{n} = 0$ and $\lim \sup a_{n} = 1$.

(d) In the forward direction $(\implies)$, suppose a bounded sequence
$a_{n}$ for which 
$$
\lim \inf a_{n} = \lim \sup a_{n} = l.
$$
Then,
we can apply the Squeeze Theorem previously proved since

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, x_{n} \leq a_{n} \leq y_{n}.
$$


This then means that $a_{n}$ converges to the same limit as $l$.

Now, for the converse $(\impliedby)$, assume that $a_{n}$ converges
to $l$. Then, construct the sequences $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$, defined
as 
$$
x_{n} = \inf \{ a_{k} : k \geq n \}
$$
and

$$
y_{n} = \sup \{ a_{k} : k \geq n \} .
$$
