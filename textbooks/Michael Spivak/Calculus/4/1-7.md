It is somewhat difficult to imagine solving the whole
inequality chain directly. Instead, we segment the inequality into
multiple parts which we individually all prove.

**That is, we first prove that** $\bm{a < \sqrt{ab}}$: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 < a < b & \implies \sqrt{a} < \sqrt{b} && \text{Square root function being strictly increasing} \\
& \implies \sqrt{a} \sqrt{a} < \sqrt{b} \sqrt{a} \\
& \implies a < \sqrt{ab}
\end{aligned}
$$


Not so fast, as we need to prove that the square roof function is
strictly increasing. Suppose $a, b \in \mathbb{R}: 0 < a < b$, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 < a < b & \implies b - a > 0 \\
& \implies \frac{b - a}{\sqrt{b} + \sqrt{a}} > 0 && \text{Difference of squares} \\
& \implies \sqrt{b} - \sqrt{a} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$


**We then prove that** $\bm{\sqrt{ab} < \frac{a + b}{2}}$ by assuming
that the inequality holds and by further developing it to arrive at a
trivially true inequality. This is exactly how one should tackle
exercises when only bewilderment is felt; one should \"play around\"
with the given inequality/equation until either a clue or an answer
becomes apparent. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{ab} < \frac{a + b}{2} & \implies 2 \sqrt{ab} < a + b \\
& \implies 0 < a + b - 2 \sqrt{ab} && (1)
\end{aligned}
$$


Most students should be capable of arriving at the inequality above but
it might seem like a dead end. By the inequality, it is obvious that we
must prove that the sum of the terms on the right-hand side is positive.
But how? Fret not, for if you rearrange the aforementioned terms, you
may observe a possible refactoring. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 < a - 2 \sqrt{ab} + b && (1)
\end{aligned}
$$


Do you see it? It is a complete square! We refactor it so as to obtain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 < { (\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}) }^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$


Now, the inequality above is trivially true since $a, b > 0$.

**Finally, we must prove that** $\bm{\frac{a + b}{2}} < b$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a < b & \implies a + b < 2b \\
& \implies \frac{a + b}{2} < b
\end{aligned}
$$


Using the property of transitivity, we have thus proven the original
inequality: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
a, b > 0 \implies 0 < a < \sqrt{ab} < \frac{a + b}{2} < b
\end{aligned}
$$
