For the forward direction $(\implies)$, suppose that

$$
z_{n} = (x_1, y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3,\dots)
$$
for any two sequences
$x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$. Suppose further that $z_{n}$ converges to $l$. By
the definition of convergence, we then have 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in
\mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N
&\implies z_{n} \in V_{\epsilon}(l).
\end{aligned}
$$


If $N$ is even, then we know that the terms

$$
(y_{\frac{N}{2}}, x_{\frac{N}{2} + 1}, y_{\frac{N}{2} + 1}, \dots)
$$

are in $V_{\epsilon}(l)$. On the other hand, if $N$ is odd, it is
instead the terms

$$
(x_{\frac{N + 1}{2}}, y_{\frac{N + 1}{2}}, x_{\frac{N + 1}{2} + 1},
y_{\frac{N + 1}{2} + 1}, \dots)
$$
that are in that
neighborhood. Therefore, if we choose $N_{xy} = \frac{N}{2}
+ 1$, we can then be certain that all $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ terms
are in that neighborhood provided that $n \geq N_{xy}$.

For the backward direction $(\impliedby)$, suppose that the sequences
$x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$ both converge to $l$. That is,

$$
\lim x_{n} = \lim y_{n} = l.
$$


Now, form the sequence $z_{n}$ such that

$$
z_{n} = (x_1, y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3,\dots).
$$


Choose any $\epsilon > 0$; by definition, since $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$
converge,

$$
\exists N_1 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N_1 \implies
\abs{x_{n} - l} < \epsilon
$$
and

$$
\exists N_2 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N_2 \implies
\abs{y_{n} - l} < \epsilon.
$$


If we choose $N = \max \{N_1, N_2\}$, then both strict inequalities are
satisfied when $n \geq N$. Consider $N_{z} = 1 + 2(N - 1)$. This value
gives us the index of the term $x_{N}$ in the sequence $z_{n}$.
Therefore, $z_{n}$ is in the neighborhood for every $n \geq N_{z}$.
