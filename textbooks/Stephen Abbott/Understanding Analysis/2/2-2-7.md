(a) $(-1)^{n}$ is frequently in the set $\{1\}$ because

$$
\forall N \in \mathbb{N}, \quad a_{N + 1} \in \{1\} \vee a_{N} \in
\{ 1\}.
$$


(b) A sequence that is eventually in a set implies that it is frequently
in it, also.

To prove this assertion formally, suppose $a_{n}$ is eventually in
the set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. By definition,

$$
\exists N_{1} \in \mathbb{N}: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N_1
\implies a_{n} \in A.
$$
Therefore,

$$
\forall N \in \mathbb{N}: N \leq N_1, \quad n = N_{1} \implies a_{n}
\in A
$$
and

$$
\forall N \in \mathbb{N}: N > N_1, \quad n = N \implies a_{n}
\in A.
$$


(c) $a_{n}$ converges to $a$ iif. for every $\epsilon > 0$, $a_{n}$ is
eventually in $V_{\epsilon}(a)$.

(d) $x_{n}$ is frequently in $(1.9, 2.1)$ but not eventually necessarily
in it. To prove that $x_{n}$ is frequently in that interval, notice
that

$$
\forall  N \in \mathbb{N}, \exists n \in \mathbb{N}: n \geq N \implies a_{n} \in (1.9, 2.1)
$$

because if the above assertion was false, then it would imply that
there is a finite number of 2s, which is a contradiction. On the
other hand, to prove that $x_{n}$ does not eventually in the
interval, consider 
$$
x_{n} = (0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, \dots).
$$
Clearly,
this contrived sequence is not eventually in $(1.9,
2.1)$.
