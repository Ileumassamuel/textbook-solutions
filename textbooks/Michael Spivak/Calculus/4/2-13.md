(a) We begin by proving the following statement to assist us in our
proof. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, z \in \mathbb{Z}, \; z \text{ is a multiple of a prime
number } k \\
\iff z^{n}
\text{ is a multiple of a prime number } k
\end{aligned}
$$
In the forward direction
($\implies$), 
$$
\begin{aligned}
z \in \mathbb{Z}: z \text{ is a multiple of prime number } k 
&\implies \exists m \in \mathbb{Z}: z = mk \\
&\implies \forall n \in \mathbb{N}z^{n} = m^{n}k^{n} \\
&\implies \forall n \in \mathbb{N}z^{n} = k(m^{n}k^{n - 1}) \\
&\implies z \text{ is a multiple of prime number } k
\end{aligned}
$$


In the other direction ($\impliedby$), 
$$
\begin{aligned}
z \in \mathbb{Z}
&\implies \exists \; b_1,b_2, \dots, b_{m} \in \mathbb{Z}:
z^{n} = b_1^nb_2^n\cdots b_{m}^n \\
&\implies \exists \; b_{i}: b_{i} = k, \quad 1 \leq i \leq m \\
&\implies z^{n} = b_1^nb_2^n\cdots k^n \cdots b_{m}^n \\
&\implies z = b_1b_2\cdots k \cdots b_{m} \\
&\implies z \text{ is a multiple of prime
number } k
\end{aligned}
$$


The proof that $\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}$ are all irrational is
left to the reader, using the proposition just proved. Hint: try a
proof by contradiction.

(b) The proof to this exercise is also left to the reader. Hint: use the
statement that was proved in (a) again.
