(a) We can use the algebraic limit theorem to convince ourselves that

$$
1 + 2a_{n} \rightarrow 1
$$
by applying rule (i) on $2a_{n}$
and (ii) on $1 + 2a_{n}$. For the terms of the denominator, we first
apply rule (i) on $3a_{n}$ to obtain 
$$
3a_{n} \rightarrow 0.
$$


Next, we apply (iii) on $4a_{n}^2$ to obtain

$$
4a_{n}^2 \rightarrow 0.
$$
Lastly, we apply (ii) on the whole sum
$1 + 3a_{n} - 4a_{n}^2$ to obtain

$$
1 + 3a_{n} - 4a_{n}^2 \rightarrow 0.
$$


Thus, putting everything together, we get 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim \frac{1 + 2a_{n}}{1 + 3a_{n} - 4a_{n}^2} 
&= \frac{\lim (1 + 2a_{n})}{\lim ( 1 + 3a_{n} - 4a_{n}^2
)} \\
&= \frac{1 + 2(0)}{1 + 3(0) -4(0^2)} = 1.
\end{aligned}
$$


(b) Though this sequence seems to converge to an undefined value because
its denominator is $a_{n}$, we can apply the the difference of
squares rule to the numerator to reveal a simplifaction. That is,

$$
\lim \frac{( a_{n} + 2 )^2 - 4}{a_{n}} = \lim \frac{a_{n} (a_{n} +
4)}{a_{n}} = \lim a_{n} + 4
$$
Thus, by applying
rule (ii) to the simplified limit, we realize that

$$
\lim \frac{( a_{n} + 2 )^2 - 4}{a_{n}} = 4.
$$


(c) This again seems like a sequence that converges to an undefined
value. However, if we multiply the sequence by $a_{n}/a_{n}$, we can
obtain a form easier to work with. That is,

$$
\lim \frac{\frac{2}{a_{n}} + 3}{\frac{1}{a_{n}} + 5}
= \lim \frac{\frac{2}{a_{n}} + 3}{\frac{1}{a_{n}} + 5} \cdot
\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n}}
= \lim \frac{2 + 3a_{n}}{1 + 5a_{n}}.
$$
Applying
rule (i) and (ii), this sequence obviously converges to 2.
