(a) Notice that

$$
\frac{2n + 1}{5n + 4} = \frac{2}{5} - \frac{3}{5 (5n + 4)}.
$$
To
obtain this result, simply divide $2n + 1$ by $5n + 4$,
$\frac{2}{5}$ times. This technique is in the appendix. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\abs{\frac{2n + 1}{5n + 4} - \frac{2}{5}} = \abs{\frac{2}{5} -
\frac{3}{5(5n + 4)} - \frac{2}{5}} = \frac{3}{5(5n + 4)} <
\epsilon
&\implies n > \frac{3 - 20\epsilon}{25\epsilon}.
\end{aligned}
$$


For any $\epsilon > 0$, by choosing $N = \frac{3 -
20\epsilon}{25\epsilon}$, if $n \geq N$, then

$$
\abs{\frac{2n + 1}{5n + 4} - \frac{2}{5}} < \epsilon.
$$


(b) Notice that

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad \abs{\frac{2n^2}{n^3 + 3}} <
\abs{\frac{2n^2}{n^3}} = \frac{2}{n}.
$$
Thus, if

$$
b_{n} = \frac{2}{n}
$$
converges, then so does

$$
a_{n} = \frac{2n^2}{n^3 + 3}.
$$


Using this trick, the rest of the proof is left to the reader.

(c) Similarly to (b), we notice that our sequence is bounded above:

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad \abs{\frac{\sin(n^2)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}}
\leq \abs{\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{n}}}.
$$
Again, by
proving that 
$$
b_{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
$$
is convergent, we
will have succeeded in proving that

$$
a_{n} = \frac{\sin(n^2)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
$$
is convergent as well
(why?). With this hint, the rest of the exercise is left to the
reader.
