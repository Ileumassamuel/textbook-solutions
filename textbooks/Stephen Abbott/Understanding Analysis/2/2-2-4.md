(a) **True.** Consider the sequence 
$$
a_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, \dots)
$$
with
an inifinite number of 1s that diverges.

(b) **False.** We falsify this statement with a proof by contradiction.
Suppose that such a sequence exists; let us denote it by $a_{n}$ and
its limit by $a$ where $a \neq 1$. However, if we choose
$\epsilon = |1 - a|$, then by definition

$$
\exists N \in \mathbb{N}(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}(n \geq N \implies
a_{n} \in V_{|1 - a|}(a))).
$$
Notice that this
is problematic because it implies that no 1s are in $V_{|1 - a|}(a)$
and, consequently, there there is a finite number of 1s (because
there could be at most be $N - 1$ 1s). Thus, we encounter a
contradiction.

(c) **True.** Consider the sequence

$$
a_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, \dots).
$$
Clearly, it diverges
and we can find $n$ consecutive number of ones for every
$n \in \mathbb{N}$.
