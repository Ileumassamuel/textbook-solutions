(a) $$x_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, \dots)$$ is zero-heavy. If you choose
    $M = 1$, then
    $$\forall N \in \mathbb{N}, \exists n \in \mathbb{N}, N \leq n \leq N + 1 \implies
                    (x_{n} = 0 \wedge x_{n + 1} = 1) \vee (x_{n} = 1 \wedge x_{n + 1} = 0).$$

(b) Yes. For any $a_{i}$, if we choose $N = i$, we then have
    $$\exists a_{i} = 0: i \leq i \leq i + M,$$ implying that there is
    an infinite number of 0s.

(c) No. Consider the sequence
    $$x_{n} = (0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, \dots)$$

(d) A sequence is not zero-heavy if for all $M \in \mathbb{N}$, there
    exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ which for all $n$ satisfying
    $N \leq n \leq N +
                    M$, $x_{n} \neq 0$.
