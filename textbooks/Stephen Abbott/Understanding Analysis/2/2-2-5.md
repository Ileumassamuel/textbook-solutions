(a) Intuitively, $a_{n} = \lfloor \frac{5}{n} \rfloor$ seems to converge
to 0. Notice that we can define $a_{n}$ piece-wise, to obtain an
insight. That is, 
$$
a_{n} = \lfloor \frac{5}{n} \rfloor = 
\begin{cases} 
5 & n = 1 \\
2 & n = 2 \\
1 & 3 \leq n \leq 5 \\
0 & n \geq 6
\end{cases}
$$
Thus, for every $\epsilon > 0$,
choose $N = 6$. We then have

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N \implies 0 = \lfloor \frac{5}{n}
\rfloor < \epsilon.
$$


(b) Intuitively, $a_{n} = \lfloor \frac{12 + 4n}{3n} \rfloor$ converges
to 1 since 
$$
b_{n} = \frac{12 + 4n}{3n}
$$
converges to
$\frac{4}{3}$. In fact, we realize that

$$
\forall n \geq 7, \quad 1 < b_{n} < 2.
$$
Thus, for every
$\epsilon > 0$, choose $N = 7$. We then have

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad n \geq N \implies 0 = \abs{\lfloor
\frac{12+4n}{3n}\rfloor - 1} < \epsilon.
$$
